    <para id="import-auto-id6009789">For those wishing to complete the task themselves, the best guide is the book by Peter and Valerie Wallage, <emphasis effect="italics">Rebuilding and Tuning Ford's Kent Crossflow Engine</emphasis>. This is a great book for anyone interested in the Kent motors. I have previously used this as a guide in rebuilding a race motor for a 1969 Lotus Type 61 Formula Ford. In addition, Jake Lamont and Tom Andresenâ€™s book entitled <emphasis effect="italics">How to Build and Maintain Competitive (yet legal) Formula Ford 1600 Engines</emphasis>, is a useful source, although more limited to Formula Ford motors to Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) racing rules. In the present case, for time limitations, it was decided to have the engine rebuilt by Farley Engines, Inc. The company owner, Curtis Farley, is one of the most respected names in building racing and performance engines in the US. </para><section id="import-auto-id1166167095274">

In addition, +.020 pistons had been fitted and a high lift cam. All of these modifications would have significantly increased the power over the stock Cortina motor.

Removal of the manifold showed that some molten metal had run into the engine past at least one of the intake valves (<link target-id="import-auto-id1166171335308"/>). One result of the complete tear-down was that it was possible to see the location where the molten aluminum from the carburetor had flowed through the intake valve and onto the piston (<link target-id="import-auto-id1166165990738"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id1166153481615"/>). </para><figure id="import-auto-id1166171335308"><media id="import-auto-id6010409" alt="">

      <title>New and replacement parts</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1166164641900">In addition to a complete rebuild of the block and head, several components were replaced by either new or used items. Since the 1600 Ford crossflow engine installed in my 1969 Lotus Seven S3 had been converted to dry-sump for racing several components were known to be in good working order and used for the present engine. The replacement items included: </para><list id="import-auto-id1166159598532" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Oil pump. </item>
        <item>Water pump and pulley. </item>

      </list>
      <para id="import-auto-id1166151984226">In addition, the mechanical fuel pump was to be replaced by an electric item so a blanking plate sourced from Dave Bean Engineering. The reason for replacing the sump was that while the external dimensions are the same as the original, the one used on the Seven S3 had baffles welded inside to minimize oil surge (<link target-id="import-auto-id1166158805320"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id5996302"/>). Even though it is intended that the Seven S4 were to be used for the street (rather than racing) the additional baffling should provide added protection for the engine against oil starvation. </para><figure id="import-auto-id1166158805320"><media id="import-auto-id8317990" alt="">

An unused manifold was amongst the spares when I purchased the Lotus Type 61 Formula Ford (also shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id7574491"/>). At some time the manifold had been port matched to the engine and significantly flowed. Unfortunately, the previous owner had used the car for auto-cross (auto testing) in which the regulations are different from Monoposto (<link url="http://www.monoposto.com/"><emphasis effect="underline">www.monoposto.com</emphasis></link>) and SCCA (<link url="http://www.scca.org/"><emphasis effect="underline">www.scca.org</emphasis></link>) Formula Ford racing in which such modifications are not allowed. However, there is no issue with its use for the street, and it was decided to use this as a direct replacement although any power gain will be negligible. </para><figure id="import-auto-id7574491"><media id="import-auto-id1166150526394" alt="">

      <title>Upgrades</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1166161385160">Since the engine was an original Cortina unit rather than the later upgraded unit, it was decided to upgrade the main caps. In addition, the need to run unleaded fuel meant that hardened valve seats were to be installed, while up-rated valves were fitted at the same time. The original camshaft was a higher performance item than stock; however, it was badly worn. So it was decided to replace it with a Kent Cams fast road cam (model BCF2). This had been previously used in the 1600 cc Kent engine used in my 1969 Seven S3. </para><para id="import-auto-id8018969">Due to the damage associated with the molten alloy flowing into the engine through the intake valves it was decided to bore the block for +.030 pistons by AE (Dave Bean Engineering). The lifters were reground and hardened by Elgin Industries (<link url="http://www.elginind.com/"><emphasis effect="underline">www.elginind.com</emphasis></link>).
